# DALiuGE Component Project Template

This project template is the starting point for people who want to develop Python based **components** for the **[DALiuGE](https://daliuge.readthedocs.io)** workflow development and execution framework. It contains everything to get you started, including project setup, dependency installation and the actual installation procedure into the DALiuGE environment.

**NOTE: This template is based on the excellent work of Bruno Rocha (https://github.com/rochacbruno/python-project-template).**

### HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE

> **DO NOT FORK** this is meant to be used from **[Use this template](https://github.com/ICRAR/daliuge-component-template/generate)** feature, which also appears instead of the usual 'Code' button on the top-right of the GitHub repository page.

1. Click on **[Use this template](https://github.com/ICRAR/daliuge-component-template/generate)**
3. Give your new DALiuGE components project a good, expressive name, but keep is as short as possible. We recommend the start with a _dlg\__ prefix (e.g. `dlg_helloWorld_cmpts`), recommendation is to use all lowercase and underscores separation for repo names.
3. Once you click OK **Wait until the first run of CI finishes(!)**
   (Github Actions will process the template and commit to your new repo).
4. If you want [codecov](https://about.codecov.io/sign-up/) Reports and Automatic Release to [PyPI](https://pypi.org)  
  On the new repository `settings->secrets` add your `PIPY_API_TOKEN` and `CODECOV_TOKEN` (get the tokens on respective websites)
5. Then clone your new components project and happy coding!

> **AGAIN**: **WAIT** until first CI run on github actions **before** cloning your new project, else some of the features might not work correctly.

### What is included in this template?

- 🖼️ **Basic** Python components [use this template](https://github.com/ICRAR/daliuge-component-template/generate)
  **or Run `make init` after cloning to generate a new project based on a template.**
- 📦 A basic [setup.py](setup.py) file to provide installation, packaging and distribution for your component.  
  Template uses setuptools because it's the de-facto standard for Python packages, you can run `make switch-to-poetry` later if you want.
- 🤖 A [Makefile](Makefile) with the most useful commands to install, test, lint, format and release your component. (Try `make help`)
- 📃 Documentation structure using [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org). This is meant to describe you components, not the template, thus it is pretty much empty to start with.
- 💬 Auto generation of change log using **gitchangelog** to keep a HISTORY.md file automatically based on your commit history on every release.
- 🐋 A simple [Containerfile](Containerfile) to build a container image for your project.  
  `Containerfile` is a more open standard for building container images than Dockerfile, you can use buildah or docker with this file.
- 🧪 Testing structure using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)
- ✅ Code linting using [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)
- 📊 Code coverage reports using [codecov](https://about.codecov.io/sign-up/)
- 🛳️ Automatic release to [PyPI](https://pypi.org) using [twine](https://twine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and github actions.
- 🎯 Entry points to execute your program using `python -m <project_name>` or `$ project_name` with basic CLI argument parsing.
- 🔄 Continuous integration using [Github Actions](.github/workflows/) with jobs to lint, test and release your project on Linux and Mac environments.

project_description

## Installation

There are multiple options for the installation, depending on how you are intending to run the DALiuGE engine, directly in a virtual environment (host) or inside a docker container. You can also install it either from PyPI (latest released version).

## Install it from PyPI

### Engine in virtual environment
```bash
pip install project_name
```
This will only work after releasing the project to PyPi.
### Engine in Docker container
```bash
docker exec -t daliuge-engine bash -c 'pip install --prefix=$DLG_ROOT/code project_name'
```
## Usage
For example the MyComponent component will be available to the engine when you specify 
```
project_name.apps.MyAppDROP
```
in the AppClass field of a Python Branch component. The EAGLE palette associated with these components are also generated and can be loaded directly into EAGLE. In that case all the fields are correctly populated for the respective components.
